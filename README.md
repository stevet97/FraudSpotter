# Self-Organizing Map for Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** to detect potential credit card frauds from a dataset. SOMs are unsupervised neural networks that can be used for clustering and anomaly detection. In this project, we use a dataset of credit card applications and identify anomalies that may represent fraudulent behavior.
